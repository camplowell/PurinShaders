# PurinShaders

A vibrant and warm shader pack that aims to keep and enhance the blocky style of Minecraft, and named after the Japanese purin (プリン) for its vanilla flavor and smooth texture.

This pack uses a bunch of fun math to integrate effects like shadows and translucency into the texture of the blocks, creating a seamless experience.
As a result, many effects don't need to be calculated to a high level of detail, keeping performance reasonable (I hope).
